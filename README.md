Executive summary

In this project we clean, explore, analyse and create different regression models for the ask_a_manager dataframe, containing self-reported information about different people around the world who have noted down their characteristics (age, industry, job title, gender, race etc) and their salaries. In our analysis, we explore the data by creating plots about our variables and their relation to total salary (annual salary + other monetary compensation), in order to visualise interesting characteristics in our dataframe. Finally, we aim to predict the total salary for people in the US by using a linear regression model which incorporates the variables of industry (top 20), years of experience in field, highest level of education completed, gender and overall years of professional experience, gender and race, achieving an R squared of 19.3% and residual standard error of 83870 dollars. Furthermore, we have provided limitations for our exploratory and regression analysis, as well as improvements to include which would make our analysis better.
